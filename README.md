      ntfy:
           msg: "deployment on {{ inventory_hostname }} is complete. üêÑ "

    - name: "different topic"
      ntfy:
            msg: "that's a wrap"
	    topic: "admin-alerts"
            attrs:
               tags: [ rotating_light, heavy_check_mark ]
               priority: 4
               actions:
